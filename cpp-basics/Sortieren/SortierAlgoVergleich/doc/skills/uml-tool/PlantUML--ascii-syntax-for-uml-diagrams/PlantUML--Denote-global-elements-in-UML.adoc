.Denote global elements in UML
*****

.How do I denote a globale function in UML diagram notation,

A _global function_ is sometimes also called _top-level function_
Such a function doesn't have any encapsulating class or other structure?

When you need to create a UML diagram for a global element in UML
can not directly model it. Here are some workarounds

* model it as static method of a special class called e.g. `global`
+
Rather than call the class or stereotype "global"
think about to put the "top-level" elements
in a well named namespace.
+
A namespace called `uiHelper` is far superior to just
having this be `arrayAnzeigen`a "top-level" function.

A UML does not allow to model top-level elements.
But then at this point you may as well put
it in a `UiHelper` class as a static method.
This is the best option to keep the UML notation and the code in sync.
